### 1)Using brute-force approach, design an algorithm to find the post-office location minimizing the average distance between the villages and the post office.
	min distance: 3 	value: 40.81489150162855

### 2)Using brute-force approach, design an algorithm to find the post-office location minimizing the maximum distance from a village to the post office.
	minimize max: 0 	value: 71.58910531638176

### 4)Analyze your designed algorithms mathematically and empirically.
	Empirical Analysis : complexity O(log n**2)
	numerical Analysis : 
		n= 5
		iterations= 20
		calculation n**2= 25
		actual  n*(n-1)= 20
